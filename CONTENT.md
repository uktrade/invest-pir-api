# Content Entry

The following notes relate to content entry via the admin:


- Two spaces at the end of a line will render a line break at that point.
- A blank line will render a new paragraph.
- Some sections contain multiple pages. Those shuld be numbered sequentially in the `Sub Page` field (1, 2, 3, etc.).
- In column content, three consecutive dashes in a separate line will trigger the next column:
  ```
  This is text in the left column

  ---

  And this is text in the right column

  ```
- To render 'quotes' prefix te line with `>`. Keep an empty line between the quote and it's source (also prefixed with a `>`):

   ```
    > “This is a quote”

    > – Mr. Smith, some institute 2020
   ```
